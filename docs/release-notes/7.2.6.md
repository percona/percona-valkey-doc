Upgrade urgency **MODERATE**.

  creating listpacks larger than 4GB (Redis#12955, Fixes Redis#12864)

### Bug fixes - Cluster

* Fix the CLUSTER SHARDS command to display accurate slot information even
  if a primary node fails ([#790], Fixes [Issue #784])

  ([#693], Fixes [Issue #619])
* Ensure only primary nodes with slots can mark another node as failed ([#634])
* Improve MEET command reliability under link failures to maintain cluster
  membership symmetry ([#461])

  single-shard cluster (Redis#12824)

### Bug fixes - Sentinel

### Bug fixes - CLI

  `--pattern` (Redis#13092)
