## Valkey 7.2.5 RC1 - Released Fri 12 Apr 2024

Upgrade urgency **LOW**.

for OSS Redis 7.2.4. Moving to a release candidate on 7.2.5, to make it clearer
this is a patch iteration as opposed to an exact copy of OSS Redis. Also includes
fixes to minor bugs present in 7.2.4 RC1 and more compatibility changes.

* Update valkey-server and valkey-cli help info to show only Valkey ([#222])
* Add compatibility for lua debugger to use 'server' instead of redis. ([#303])

### Bug fixes

* Fix module event name to maintain Redis compatibility. ([#289])
* Fix issue where Redis symlinks were created with the wrong name. ([#282])
