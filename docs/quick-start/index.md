# Quickstart guide

**Valkey** is an open-source high-performance in-memory data store, using official packages, containers, or by building from source. This guide explains how to install Valkey on supported Linux distributions and containerized environments using Percona-recommended methods.

Valkey is fully compatible with Redis clients and protocols, making it a drop-in replacement for most Redis-based use cases.

Valkey supports scenarios such as:

- Caching frequently accessed data
- Session management
- Real-time analytics
- Pub/sub systems and background queueing

!!! note
    These instructions are intended for Linux-based systems. For other platforms, consult the [Valkey community documentation](https://valkey.io/docs/).
